    In the Network File System version4 (NFSv4) a client
    may be granted a delegation for a file. This allows the
    client to act as the authority of the file's metadata
    and data. In this document,
    we introduce some new semnatics to the delegation process
    which allows the client to update the server with both
    the access and modify times.
    It becomes an extension of NFSv4.2
    <xref target='RFC7862' /> and is built on top of the
    external data representation (XDR) <xref target='RFC4506' />
    generated from <xref target='RFC7863' />.
