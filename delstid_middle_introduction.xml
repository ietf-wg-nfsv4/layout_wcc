    In the Network File System version4 (NFSv4) a client
    may be granted a delegation for a file. This allows the
    client to act as the authority of the file's metadata
    and data. In this document,
    we introduce some new semnatics to both the open and
    the delegation process
    which allows the client to: 

    <list style='symbols'>
      <t>
        determine the extension of OPEN
        (see Section 18.16 of <xref target="RFC5661" />) flags.
      </t>

      <t>
        during the OPEN procedure, get either the open
        or delegation stateids, but not both.
      </t>

      <t>
        detect an offline file, which may be located off premise.
      </t>

      <t>
        cache both the access and modify times, reducing the
        number of times the client needs to go to the server
        to get that information.
      </t>
    </list>

    Using the process detailed in <xref target="RFC8178" />,
    the revisions in this document become an extension of NFSv4.2
    <xref target='RFC7862' />. They are built on top of the
    external data representation (XDR) <xref target='RFC4506' />
    generated from <xref target='RFC7863' />.

        <t hangText='delegation:'> A file delegation, which is
          a recallable lock that assures the holder that inconsistent
          opens and file changes cannot occur so long as the
          delegation is held.

        <t hangText='stateid:'>  A stateid is a 128-bit quantity
          returned by a server that uniquely defines state held
